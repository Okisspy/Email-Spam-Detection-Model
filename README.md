# Email-Spam-Detection-Model
This model evaluates 5,574 email messages having spam (bad emails) and ham (good email). The goal is to predict spam emails and attention was given to "Precision" during the model validation process, since we have a higher cost/penalty of False Positives (wrongfully classifying a good email as bad/spam email). Different classifiers were used in comparism to see which favors our prediction the most.
